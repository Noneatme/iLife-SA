# About
The MTA: San Andreas iLife Gamemode was created by ReWrite back in March 2014. 
Later, Developers like Dawi, Noneatme, Samy, Audifire and MasterM joined the project.

This Version is the latest unsupported version, last developed by me (Noneatme).
You can post Issues or Pull-Requests, we are not sure if we accept them and fix the issues.
We do not give support. Please do not even ask about it.

# Developers
See the DEVELOPERS.md file for more informations about the developers of this gamemode.
The main developers are: ReWrite(Danny), Noneatme(Gunvarrel)(Me), Audifire, Samy, MasterM.

# Warning
This gamemode contains developer comments and thoughs. They might have been randomly wrote down in any script file of this
repository. It's possible that these notes are in containment of mature language, bad grammar and non-english language. View at your own risk.

# Database
The Database File is not included in this Repo. Maybe we will add the database dump in the future.

# The Gamemode
The Gamemode is a single gamemode and does not exists within a bundle of wild resources, as seen on many other servers. 
Please note: Any gamemode which exists only as a bundle of resources is not a gamemode. Please don't do this, this is a very dumb idea.
The script initiation will take place at the server side cCore.lua. Object Instances will be instantiated in the client and server side cObjectCreator.lua classes.
